    ######## Script to generate attendance report from Zoom 'participants' logs ########
    ####################################################################################
    Do please drop me an email to let me know if you find this script useful (or have any additions to contribute):
    jonathan.taylor at glasgow.ac.uk
        -- Jonathan Taylor, Glasgow University, October 2020

    Version 2.0 updates: Semi-automated feature to merge personal and university email addresses. Generate report tables by day and by week.
    Version 3.0 update:  Command-line parameters

    Command line usage:
                One or more parameters giving paths to directory containing .csv files.
                    Each directory will be processed independently. The directory will be scanned for all files of the form
                    "participants*.csv" (downloaded from zoom - see below), and attendance reportsÂ will be generated in that same directory.
                    If no directories specified, script runs on current directory
                    (If you include *unquoted* wildcards in your command line paths, all matches will be processed independently)
                Can also include an optional parameter (e.g. -m2) specifying that students must attend a minimum of 2 sessions.
                    Warnings will then be generated for any students not meeting that threshold
                    (but watch out for students who may have signed in under a personal and a university email address,
                     if these have not been successfully paired together)

    Outputs:
    - a file 'meeting-report.csv' listing all the participants, and giving a chronological account of which meetings
      they have attended (and for how long). For now, this is just a list of all dates that the student has attended
      (and the total time they attended for).
    - a file 'meeting-report-by-day.csv' giving a table of participants vs dates attended.
    - a file 'meeting-report-by-week.csv' giving a table of participants vs weeks attended
      (helpful for labs where different students attend once each, on different days of the week)
    - warnings about low-attending students

    Limitations:
    - At the moment the output data is sorted by email address (which is not a very helpful ordering
      given that the students have numerical email addresses). However, email address seemed like the most
      reliable thing to use as a key, given that some students change their display name on Zoom.
    - Script currently assumes only one meeting per day, and will fuse into one entry if there was
      more than one separate 'participants' file referring to the same calendar date.
    - Signing in to zoom is no proof that the student is actually present or engaged at the computer at the other end!

    Customization (Glasgow University):
    - To merge records between students' personal and university email addresses,
      manually edit the code that initializes the dictionary 'emailMapping'.
      If you just run the script without this, the code will try and make suggestions about possible pairings it has guessed for you.
      You would then need to manually edit the emailMapping dictionary to add those pairings.
    - If it is hard to distinguish demonstrator emails from undergraduate student emails,
      you may need to edit knownDemonstratorEmails to manually identify demonstrator emails
    Additional customization (other universities):
    - Edit the function "StaffEmail()" to identify staff/demonstrator email addresses that should be excluded from the reports
    - Edit the function "UniversityStudentEmail()" to identify email addresses that are official university stuent email addresses
    
    To download the participants files:
    The meeting owner should go to "edit meeting" then Reports -> Usage and search for the relevant date range.
    This brings up a table of data about meetings. Click on the number (hyperlink) in the "Participants" column of the table,
    and that pops up a list of participants. Click "Export", then hit close/escape to go back to the main table.
    Repeat for the other meetings of interest, and then gather all the downloaded files into a suitable directory for processing.
