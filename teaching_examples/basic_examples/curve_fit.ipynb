    "# Very brief recap on functions\n",
    "A *function* in Python behaves very much like a mathematical function such as $sin(x)$. We provide certain numerical *arguments* ($x$, in this case) and the result of the function is another number. A reminder of the terminology associated with functions in Python: A **function** \"takes\" one or more **arguments** (sometimes also referred to as **parameters**) that it operates on, and it **returns** a **result**. We then **call** the function from our code, every time we want to run the function, **passing** it the particular arguments we want it to run with each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advanced note: some programming languages distinguish between a \"pure function\" (which acts just like a mathematical function) that takes arguments and returns a result, and a \"routine\" (which may look similar, but might not take any arguments or return a value at all, and can have \"side effects\" - for example, it might print out a message, plot a graph, save a file to disk, etc). For example, strictly speaking, `silly_curve_fit` (introduced later) is a routine rather than a pure function*"

When we call `silly_curve_fit`, the first argument we pass to it is the **name** of the other function we previously defined (`quadratic`). In that line of code that calls `silly_curve_fit`, we are not directly **calling** `quadratic` (using round brackets after the word 'quadratic'). We are just passing the **name** of the function `quadratic` as the first argument to the function `silly_curve_fit`. `silly_curve_fit` will then in turn call our function every time it wants to evaluate the function. `silly_curve_fit` codes our generalised **algorithm** (albeit a silly one!) for curve fitting, but we can run that algorithm again and again with different specific functions (not just our `quadratic` function) if we wish."

In general (subject to a few ground rules) you are allowed to write the name of an argument (`p0` in this case) as well as the value you are passing in for it. Either approach is acceptable, but with curve_fit people often write `p0=(1)` (or equivalent) to help them remember what the `(1)` is actually for. That trick can be particularly helpful when you call a function that takes very large numbers of arguments.\n",
